Lizzie Chapman, co-founder and chief executive of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zestmoney" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zestmoney">ZestMoney, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told TechCrunch in an interview that the new investment is part of an extended Series B round, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/zestmoney-raises-20m/">first tranche of which was announced in April this year</a>.</p>\n<p>The extended Series B round brings <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zestmoney" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zestmoney">ZestMoney&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> total raise to-date to $63 million, she said.</p>\n<p>The penetration of credit cards remains very low in India; roughly three in 100 people in the country have a credit card. This has meant that very few people in the nation have a traditional credit score, which banks heavily rely on to establish one&#8217;s credit worthiness before issuing them a loan.</p>\n<p>Moreover, small loans don&#8217;t generate lucrative returns for banks, giving them less incentive to write such cheques. In recent years, a growing number of Indian startups has stepped in to address this void.</p>\n<p>ZestMoney assesses other data points and uses AI to help these people build a profile and become credit-worthy. The startup has\xa0partnered with over 3,000 merchants &#8212; up from some 800 in late April &#8212; including Flipkart, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Paytm to offer financing options to customers at point-of-sale.</p>\n<p>It has amassed more than 6 million users, who can access credit of $140 to $3,000. To make the deal even better, many of these merchants offer interest-free option to customers, provided they could pay back in a specified amount of time.</p>\n<p>The startup, which maintains partnership with nearly every online payments processor in the nation including Razorpay, BillDesk, Cashfree, CCAvenue, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/payu-t-rkiye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="payu-t-rkiye">PayU,\xa0has <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> also made a push in the brick and mortar market by inking deals with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/xiaomi-mi-credit-india-launch/">Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi</a>, and Pine Labs, which has deployed over 300,000 point-of-sale machines across the country.</p>\n<p>ZestMoney has also raised an unspecified amount of debt, which it uses to finance credit to customers. It recently entered in\xa0a strategic partnership with Credit Saison, a Japanese financial services company affiliated to Mizuho Financial Group, to deploy $100 million toward expanding digital lending in the country.</p>\n<p>Philip Aldis, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said the firm&#8217;s investment in ZestMoney would enable more households in India to access credit. &#8220;We look forward to leveraging our global experience and network for the continued growth of ZestMoney,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Goldman Sachs has written checks to a handful of startups in India, including logistics startup\xa0BlackBuck, home rental platform NextAway, news aggregator DailyHunt, and online furniture store PepperFry.</p>\n<p>The New York-headquartered firm, one of the world&#8217;s largest trading banks, has also invested in a number of financial startups including NuBank, a Brazilian firm that offers digital credit card to smartphone users. It is also the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-apple-card-works/">banking partner for Apple Card</a>.</p>\n<p>ZestMoney aims to disburse credit of worth $1 billion in 18 months and reach 300 million users one day. Digital lending in India is expected to be a $1 trillion opportunity in the next five years, according to Boston Consulting Group.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~4/dSwWFhccClY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/zestmoney-goldman-sachs/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '1925434', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/zestmoney-goldman-sachs/'}, {'title': 'Amazon will establish a new headquarters for its Kuiper satellite broadband project', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/Amazon', 'value': 'Amazon will establish a new headquarters for its Kuiper satellite broadband project'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/p5UAg_AWM4g/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/p5UAg_AWM4g/', 'comments': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/amazon-will-establish-a-new-headquarters-for-its-kuiper-satellite-broadband-project/#respond', 'published': 'Wed, 18 Dec 2019 21:07:29 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=18, tm_hour=21, tm_min=7, tm_sec=29, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=352, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Darrell Etherington'}], 'author': 'Darrell Etherington', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Darrell Etherington'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Aerospace', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Space', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'TC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Amazon', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Google', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'internet connectivity', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'north america', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'OneWeb', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'redmond', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'satellite', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'satellite internet', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Satellites', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Seattle', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'spacecraft', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'spaceflight', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'SpaceX', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'starlink', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'washington', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://techcrunch.com/?p=1925800', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Amazon is ramping operations for its Kuiper project, its forthcoming high-speed satellite internet product, with a new HQ and R&#38;D facility.

that built the <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/01/09/ray/">Project Ray</a> open-source distributed programming framework out of UC Berkeley &#8212; Robert Nishihara, Philipp Moritz and Ion Stoica, and Berkeley professor Michael I. Jordan &#8212; has raised $20.6 million in a Series A round of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation also from NEA, Intel Capital, Ant Financial, Amplify Partners, 11.2 Capital and The House Fund.</p>\n<p>The company plans to use the money to build out its first commercial products &#8212; details of which are still being kept under wraps but will more generally include the ability to easily scale out a computing project from one laptop to a cluster of machines; and a group of libraries and applications to manage projects. These are expected to launch next year.</p>\n<p><span class="s1">&#8220;Right now we are focused on making Ray a standard for building applications,&#8221; said Stoica in an interview. &#8220;The company will build tools and a runtime platform for Ray. So, if you want to run a Ray application securely and with high performance then you will use our product.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>The funding is partly strategic: Intel is one of the big companies that has been using Ray for its own computing projects, alongside <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Microsoft and Ant Financial.</p>\n<p>“Intel IT has been leveraging Ray to scale Python workloads with minimal code modifications,” said Moty Fania, principal engineer and chief technology officer for Intel IT’s Enterprise and Platform Group, in a statement. “With the implementation into Intel’s manufacturing and testing processes, we have found that Ray helps increase the speed and scale of our hyperparameter selection techniques and auto modeling processes used for creating personalized chip tests. For us, this has resulted in reduced costs, additional capacity and improved quality.”</p>\n<p>With an impressive user list like this for the free-to-use Ray, you might ask yourself, what is the purpose of Anyscale? As Stoica and Nishihara explained, the idea will be to create simpler and easier ways to implement Ray, to make it usable whether you&#8217;re one of the Amazons of the world, or a more modest, and possibly less tech-centric operation.</p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We see that this will be valuable mostly for companies who do not have engineering experts,&#8221; Stoica said. </span></p>\n<p>The problem that Anyscale is solving is a central one to the future of large-scale, involved computing projects: there are an increasing array of problems that are being tackled with computing solutions, but as the complexity of the work involved increases, there is a limit to how much work a single machine (even a big one) can handle. (Indeed, Anyscale cites <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/idc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="idc">IDC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> figures estimating that the amount of data created and copied annually will reach 175 zettabytes by 2025.)</p>\n<p>While one day there may be quantum-computing machines that can run efficiently and at scale to address these kinds of tasks, today this isn&#8217;t a realistic option, and so distributed computing has emerged as a solution.</p>\n<p>Ray was devised as a standard to use to implement distributed computing environments, but on its own it&#8217;s too technical for the uninitiated to use.</p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Imagine you’re a biologist,&#8221; added Nishihara. &#8220;You can write a simple program</span><span class="s1"> and run it at a large scale, but to do that successfully you need not only to be a biology expert but a computing expert. That&#8217;s just way too high a barrier.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p class="p1">The people behind Anyscale (and Ray) have a long and very credible list of other work behind them that speaks to the opportunities that are being spotted here. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Stoica">Stoica</a>, for example, was also the co-founder of Databricks, Conviva and one of the original developers of Apache Spark.</p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I worked on Databricks with Ion and that’s how it started,&#8221; Andreessen Horowitz co-founder </span><span class="s1">Ben Horowitz said in an interview. He added that the firm has been a regular investor into projects coming out of UC Berkeley. Ray, and more specifically Anyscale, is notable for its relevance to today&#8217;s computing needs.</span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;W</span><span class="s1">ith Ray it was a very attractive project because of the open-source metrics but also because of the issue it addresses,&#8221; he said. </span></p>\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been grappling with Moore&#8217;s Law being over, but more interestingly, it&#8217;s inadequate for things like artificial intelligence applications,&#8221; where increasing computing power is needed that outstrips what any single machine can do. &#8220;</span><span class="s1">You have to be able to deal with distributed computing, but the problem for everyone but Google is that distributed computing is hard, so we have been looking for a solution.&#8221;</span></p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~4/yek07uQtOA0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/anyscale-ray-project-distributed-computing-a16z/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '1924851', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/anyscale-ray-project-distributed-computing-a16z/'}, {'title': 'Amazon’s third-party merchants are now barred from using FedEx Ground for Prime shipments', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/Amazon', 'value': 'Amazon’s third-party merchants are now barred from using FedEx Ground for Prime shipments'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/Xh1gTgd87mg/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/Xh1gTgd87mg/', 'comments': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/amazons-third-party-merchants-are-now-barred-from-using-fedex-ground-for-prime-shipments/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 17 Dec 2019 02:52:44 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=17, tm_hour=2, tm_min=52, tm_sec=44, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=351, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Catherine Shu'}], 'author': 'Catherine Shu', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Catherine Shu'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Logistics', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'TC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Amazon', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Amazon.com', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'eCommerce', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'fedex', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://techcrunch.com/?p=1924819', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Third-party vendors were told by Amazon over the weekend that they are barred from using FedEx’s ground delivery services for Prime shipments.

Kano founder Alex Klein confirmed in a call with TechCrunch that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kano" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kano">Kano <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will have 50 staff going into next year. Although he said the kid-focused learn to code device business is also adding jobs in engineering and design, as well as eliminating other roles as it shifts focus.</p>\n<p>He also suggested some of the cuts are seasonal and cyclical &#8212; related to getting through the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Per Klein, jobs are being taking out as the company moves from building atop the Raspberry Pi platform &#8212; where it started, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/19/the-kano-build-it-yourself-computer-for-kids-raises-1-4m-on-kickstarter/">back in 2013</a>, with its crowdfunded DIY computer &#8212; to a Windows-based learning platform.</p>\n<p>Other factors he pointed to in relation to the layoffs include a new manufacturing setup in China, with a &#8220;simpler, larger contract manufacturer&#8221;; fewer physical retail outlets to support, with Kano leaning more on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (which he said is &#8220;cheaper to support&#8221;); fewer dependencies on large partners and agencies, with Klein claiming 18% of US parents with kids aged 6-12 are now familiar with the brand, reducing its marketing overhead; and a desire to shrink the number of corporate managers vs makers on its books as &#8220;we&#8217;ve seen a stronger response to our first-party Kano products &#8212; Computer Kit, Pixel Kit, Motion Sensor Kit &#8212; than expected this year&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have brought on some roles that are more focused on this new platform [Kano PC], and some roles that were focused on the Raspberry Pi are no longer with us,&#8221; he also told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>Kano unveiled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/kano-the-kids-focused-coding-and-hardware-startup-inks-deal-with-microsoft-launches-300-kano-pc/">first Windows-based PC this fall</a>. The 11.6-inch touch-enabled, Intel Atom-powered computer costs $300 &#8212; which puts it in the ballpark price-range of Google&#8217;s Chromebook.</p>\n<p>The tech giant has maintained a steady focus on the educational computing market &#8212; putting a competitive squeeze on smaller players like Kano who are trying to carve out a business selling their own brand of STEM-focused hardware. Against the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Goliath, Klein touts factors such as relative repairability and attention to computing performance for the Kano PC (which he claims is &#8220;on a par with the Surface Go&#8221;), in addition to having now thrown its lot in with rival giant, Microsoft.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The more and more we got into school environments the more and more we were in conversations with major North American distributors to schools, the more we saw that people wanted that &#8216;DIY&#8217;&#8230; product design, they wanted the hackability and extensibility of the kit, they wanted the tools to be open source and manipulable but they also wanted to be able to run Photoshop and to run Class Dashboard and to run <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Office. And so that was when we struck the partnership with Microsoft,&#8221; said Klein.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Windows computer is packed with content and curriculum for teachers and an integration with Microsoft Teams which requires a different sort of development capability,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The roles we&#8217;re adding are around subscription, they&#8217;re around the computer, building new applications and tools for the computer and continuing to enrich the number of projects that are available for our members now &#8212; so we&#8217;re doing things like allowing people to connect the sensors in their wands to household IoT devices. We&#8217;re introducing, over the Christmas period, a new collaborative drawing app.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to Klein, Kano is &#8220;already seeing demand for 60,000 units in this next calendar year&#8221; for its Windows-based PC &#8212; which he said is &#8220;well beyond what we expect&#8230; given the price-point&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Although he did not put a figure on exact sales to date of the Kano PC.</p>\n<p>He also\xa0<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">confirmed </span>Kano will be dialling back the range of products it offers next year.</p>\n<p>It recently emerged that an own-brand camera device, which Kano first trailed back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/kano-moves-beyond-pi-with-code-your-own-device-kits-for-kids/">2016</a>, will not now be shipping. Klein also told us that another co-branded Disney product they&#8217;d been planning for 2020 is being &#8220;put back&#8221; &#8212; with no new date for release as yet.</p>\n<p>Klein denied sales have been lacklustre &#8212; claiming the current <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/kano-will-start-releasing-star-wars-and-other-disney-branded-products-later-this-year/"><em>Star War</em>s and <em>Frozen</em> e-products</a> have &#8220;done enough for us&#8221;. (While a co-branded <em>Harry Potter</em> e-wand is selling faster than expected, per Klein, who said they had expected to have stock until March but are &#8220;selling out&#8221;.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;The reorganization we&#8217;ve done has nothing to do with growth and users,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;We are on track to sell through more units as well as products at a higher average selling price this fiscal year. We&#8217;re selling out of wands when we expected to have stock all the way to March. We have more pre-launch demand for the Kano PC than anything we&#8217;ve ever done.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of the additional, co-branded Disney e-product which is being delayed &#8212; and may not now launch at all next year &#8212; Klein told us: &#8220;The fact is we&#8217;re in negotiations with Disney around this &#8212; and around the timing of it. Given that we&#8217;re not certain we&#8217;re going to be doing it in 2020 some of the contractor roles in particular that we brought on to do the licensing sign off pieces, to develop some of the content around those brands, some of the apparatus set up to manage those partnerships &#8212; we don&#8217;t need any more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We introduced three new hardware SKUs this year. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll do three new hardware SKUs next year,&#8221; he added, confirming the intention is to trim the number of device launches in 2020 to focus on the Kano PC.</p>\n<p>One source we spoke to suggested Kano is considering sunsetting its partner strategy entirely. However Klein did not go that far in his comments to us.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been riding a certain bear for a few years. We&#8217;re jumping to a new bear. That&#8217;s always going to create a bit of exhilaration. But I think this is a place of real promise,&#8221; was how he couched the pivot.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think what Kano does better than anyone else in the world is crafting an experience around technology that opens up its attributes to a wider audience,&#8221; Klein also said when asked whether hardware or software will be its main focus going forward. &#8220;The hardware element is crucial and beautiful and we make some of the world&#8217;s most interesting dynamic physical products. It&#8217;s an often told story that hardware&#8217;s very hard and is brutal &#8212; and yeah, because if you get it right you change the fabric of society.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard for me to draw a line between hardware and software for the business because we&#8217;ve always been asked that and seven years into the business we&#8217;ve found the greatest things that people do with the products&#8230; it&#8217;s always when there&#8217;s a combination of the two. So we&#8217;re proud that we&#8217;re good at combining the two and we&#8217;re going to continue to do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The STEM device space has been going through bumpy times in recent years as early hype and investment has failed to translate into sustained revenues at every twist and turn.</p>\n<p>The category is certainly filled with challenges &#8212; from low barrier to entry leading to plentiful (if varied quality) competition, to the demands of building safe, robust and appealing products for (fickle) kids that tightly and reliably integrate hardware and software, to checking all the relevant boxes and processes to win over teachers and support schools&#8217; curriculum requirements that&#8217;s essential for selling direct to the education market.</p>\n<p>Given so many demands on STEM device makers it&#8217;s not surprising this year has seen a number of these startups exiting to other players and/or larger electronics makers &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/sphero-is-buying-littlebits/">Sphero picking up littleBits</a>. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/sphero-lays-off-dozens-as-it-shifts-focus-to-education/">couple of years ago</a> Sphero went through its own pivot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/sphero-is-finished-making-star-wars-products/">away from selling co-branded Disney</a> &#8216;learn to code&#8217; gizmos to zoom in on the education space.</p>\n<p>While another UK-based STEM device maker &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/reliability-concerns-raised-over-pi-tops-stem-learning-laptop/">pi-top</a> &#8212; has also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/london-edtech-startup-pi-top-sees-layoffs-after-major-contract-loss/">through</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/more-layoffs-at-pivoting-london-edtech-startup-pi-top/">several rounds of layoffs</a> recently, apparently as part of its own pivot to the U.S. edtech market.</p>\n<p>More consolidation in the category seems highly likely. And given the new relationship between Kano and Microsoft joining Redmond, via acquisition, may be the obvious end point for the startup.</p>\n<p>Per the <em>Telegraph</em>&#8216;s report, Kano is in the process of looking to raise more funding. However Klein did not comment when asked to confirm the company&#8217;s funding situation.</p>\n<p>The startup last reported a raise just over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/kano-raises-28m-as-its-its-kid-friendly-computer-kits-hit-4500-stores/">two years ago</a> &#8212; when it closed a $28M Series B round led by Thames Trust and Breyer Capital. Index Ventures, the Stanford Engineering Venture Fund, LocalGlobe, Marc Benioff, John Makinson, Collaborative Fund, Triple Point Capital, and Barclays also participated.</p>\n<p><em>TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden contributed to this report</em></p>\n<p><em>We updated this report to correct a typo in the founder&#8217;s surname\xa0</em></p>\n<div class="embed breakout">\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UsNHj3UMSs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/gift-guide-stem-toys-for-your-builders-in-training/">Gift Guide: STEM toys for your builders-in-training</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title="&#8220;Gift Guide: STEM toys for your builders-in-training&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/26/gift-guide-stem-toys-for-your-builders-in-training/embed/#?secret=UsNHj3UMSs" data-secret="UsNHj3UMSs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~4/_9WsEhrU9X8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/kid-focused-stem-device-startup-kano-sees-layoffs-as-it-puts-disney-e-device-on-ice/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '1924360', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/kid-focused-stem-device-startup-kano-sees-layoffs-as-it-puts-disney-e-device-on-ice/'}, {'title': 'Amazon launches Audible Suno free app featuring short-stories in India', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/Amazon', 'value': 'Amazon launches Audible Suno free app featuring short-stories in India'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/b-StG03uCAs/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/b-StG03uCAs/', 'comments': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/amazon-audible-suno-india/#respond', 'published': 'Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:23:45 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=12, tm_hour=16, tm_min=23, tm_sec=45, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=346, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Manish Singh'}], 'author': 'Manish Singh', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Manish Singh'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Apps', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Asia', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Media', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Mobile', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Amazon', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Audible', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'india', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://techcrunch.com/?p=1923755', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Amazon is having another go at expanding its reach to listeners in India.

The mainstream attention is warranted. According to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pwc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pwc">PwC, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> AI “could contribute up to\xa0<a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/analytics/assets/pwc-ai-analysis-sizing-the-prize-report.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/analytics/assets/pwc-ai-analysis-sizing-the-prize-report.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576224577930000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3XYmvOfkofENN8UaSBsi3CJ2lJQ">$15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030</a>, more than the current output of China and India combined.”</p>\n<p>AI is at a crossroads, and its long-term outlook is still hotly debated. Despite social media giants, automotive companies and numerous other industries investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI, many automation technologies are not yet directly generating revenue and instead are forecasted to become profitable in the coming decades. This creates additional uncertainty of AI’s true market potential. The realistic potential value of AI is unknown, yet, as the technology advances, the ultimate impact could be of great consequence to virtually every economy.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons to view AI’s future from an optimistic lens, however: chatbots provide significant\xa0evidence for AI’s positive impact\xa0on both business growth and employment markets. Today, chatbots are increasingly capable of mimicking human interactions and conversations to assist business-to-business, business-to-consumer, business-to-government, advertising audiences and other diverse groups. The evolution of the cognitive computer science behind conversational chatbots is perhaps one of the best examples of AI technologies driving revenue. Further, chatbot technology shows some of the greatest promise for augmenting, rather than replacing human workers.</p>\n<h2><strong>AI is driving value while augmenting human workers</strong></h2>\n<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chatbots" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chatbots">Chatbots <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are delivering real revenue today for some of the world’s leading financial services (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bank-of-america" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bank-of-america">Bank of America), <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> retail (Levi’s), and technology companies (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zendesk" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zendesk">Zendesk) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.\xa0We’re seeing more consumers taking the next step in a transaction or even making a purchase decision based off conversations with chatbots. Beyond driving sales, chatbots have numerous applications to a wide range of organizations. Nonprofits, NGOs, and even political campaigns find value in deploying chatbots to help handle the influx of inquiries from stakeholders and relevant audiences.</p>\n<p>Rather than these chatbots replacing human workers, organizations are finding chatbots to be a helpful and value-creating opportunity that frees employees to focus on more strategic tasks.

A chatbot’s ability to simultaneously hold tens of thousands of conversations — pulling from many millions of data points — is comparable to what a human customer service rep could accomplish in more than 1,000 years of nonstop work. Scaling customer service via AI allows service professionals to focus on big picture and more complex issues, and it provides rich data on customer interactions.

Ultimately, chatbots are on track to showcase some of the most optimistic examples of AI augmentation.

But we were far more interested in discussing the future of the company, which is best known for providing instant credit to online shoppers at the point of checkout and is growing fast, with nearly 3,000 employees across 17 countries. Klarna has also begun competing more aggressively in the U.S. &#8212; as well as fending off a growing spate of competitors, from publicly traded<a href="https://www.afterpay.com/en-AU/index"> AfterPay</a> to Max Levchin&#8217;s <a href="https://www.affirm.com/">Affirm </a>to <a href="https://sezzle.com/">Sezzle</a>, a company in Minneapolis that seemingly appeared from out of the blue a few years ago.</p>\n<p>Of course, the toughest competition of all may come from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Google, which are increasingly embedding their payment systems &#8212; Amazon Pay and and Google Pay &#8212; into the sites of merchants. We talked with Siemiatkowski about how <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/klarna" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="klarna">Klarna <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> survives as they gobble up more of the retail industry. We also asked about whether Amazon might be an acquirer, or whether Klarna might be eyeing an IPO in 2020 instead. You can check out our conversation below. It has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: The last time we sat down together was four years or so ago, when Klarna was best known for its checkout product. What are some of the ways in which the company has evolved since then?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: There&#8217;s a massive opportunity. For consumers, when they shop online today, they have so many friction points. One of them might be the ability to get free credit without all the fees and things that people associate with credit cards. But there&#8217;s also other things like, where&#8217;s my package? When will it arrive? How do I do returns? Where are the best offers? Where are the best discounts? There&#8217;s a lot of things that people still struggle with. And so what we&#8217;re trying to do is create that super-smooth shopping experience, and the more problems we solve for these customers, the better, and the happier they are, and the more they&#8217;re going to use it.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: Do you have any other financial products, like [longer-term] loans?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: We do direct type of payments like that. And then, in some countries here in Europe, we&#8217;ve already launched a plastic card, as well. So you can use this like that. And then we also do this kind of Mint.com-like financial dashboard that shows you your spending habits, and all that kind of stuff.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re adding this hub in Berlin, but you&#8217;re already in Germany&#8211;</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Yes, Germany is actually our largest market. In Germany, we have about 30 million users, which, you know, takes us about 10 million ahead of that American wallet thing [<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal], <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which is quite cool. So Germany is super important for us, but right now what&#8217;s exciting is the U.S., so right now we&#8217;re adding customers at a pace that will be about six million customers on an annual basis right now. So the U.S. is really taking off.</p>\n<p><div id="attachment_1923897" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1923897" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49204023052_6746bc21e0_k.jpg" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1923897" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49204023052_6746bc21e0_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49204023052_6746bc21e0_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49204023052_6746bc21e0_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49204023052_6746bc21e0_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49204023052_6746bc21e0_k.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49204023052_6746bc21e0_k.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49204023052_6746bc21e0_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1923897" class="wp-caption-text">BERLIN, GERMANY &#8211; DECEMBER 11: Co-founder and CEO of Klarna Sebastian Siemiatkowski and Connie Loizos speak on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin 2019 at Arena Berlin on December 11, 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

If you look at those two things going on here, first is that millennials, in the U.S. and U.K., they don&#8217;t have credit cards, they have debit cards &#8212; 70% of millennials in the U.S. only have debit cards. But they&#8217;re still looking sometimes to get a cash flow ease. What&#8217;s good about our services is it doesn&#8217;t cost a consumer anything, so it&#8217;s not like the old credit cards, which were really expensive for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s merchant-funded, so that allows the consumers to then sometimes be able to either ease their cash flow by paying in four installments, or try before they buy [meaning they can defer the payment for some period] and stuff like. People forget that people who have debit cards have much harder issues shopping online than people with credit cards, and that&#8217;s a big piece of what we&#8217;re solving for.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: Do you always break the payments into four installments? Do you customize these plans?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Breaking [into] four [payments] is great and that&#8217;s one option. What we&#8217;ve seen is that consumers have different needs, so some people really like our try-before-you-buy product [where] you pay nothing at the time but then [pay] everything 30 days later when you receive the products. Sometimes, if it&#8217;s a bigger purchase, like you&#8217;re buying a sofa or something, you split it over 24 months of financing or something like that, which is kind of different. And sometimes people just want to pay for everything instantly. So we just want to make sure that people have all the options that they want.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: How much can users spend? What&#8217;s the upper boundary?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: I&#8217;m sure there is one but it&#8217;s really hard to answer because it&#8217;s very individual, on an individual basis.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: And to be clear, you&#8217;re buying these receivables from merchants at a discount? Is that how it works?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Basically, the merchant sets up with us, they pay us a merchant fee just like they do with PayPal or somebody else. Then we process the payments for them, and we take the full risk, and all the customer care and everything related to the transaction.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re not using your [venture funding] to do this. You have a bank charter in Sweden . . .</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Yes, we&#8217;re a fully licensed bank and we have deposits to fund the balance sheet. So people in Germany can actually save with Klarna and get 1%, which doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but it&#8217;s massively more than they get with any of the traditional banks in Germany.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: What about interest fees and late fees? How do those work?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Basically, we keep them extremely low. There are sometimes if you&#8217;re late, there might be a late fee, but the whole purpose here is that it&#8217;s merchant-funded. So merchants pay for this, and the consumers get a much better product than the traditional credit card or other options.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the default rate?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Super low. If you look at overall Klarna, for all markets, it&#8217;s less than 1%.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: There is a competitor of yours, AfterPay, that was criticized last year because something like a quarter of its revenue was coming from late payments. Where [is your revenue coming from]?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Most of it is coming from merchant fees, and late fees in general are never bigger than the losses that you&#8217;re making. But I think it&#8217;s definitely an important topic, where all the companies in this industry need to be very careful about how you set up your products.</p>\n<p>I think Klarna &#8212; maybe because we&#8217;ve been around longer than the competitor you&#8217;re referring to and because we&#8217;re five times their size in totality &#8212; maybe we have just come a little bit further in how we think about consumer value and making sure that fees are right and so forth. So those are important topics to keep an eye on. But I also think that what&#8217;s even more important is that you have this credit card industry, which in general has charged massive interest rates, a lot of late fees, and been not a very transparent and great industry. And I think, actually, the big opportunity is for people like us, and the one you refer to and others, to disrupt that industry. It&#8217;s the credit card industry that we&#8217;re going after.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: Sure, and I&#8217;m not going to defend the credit card industry, but did you say what your interest fees are?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: It depends on an individual basis, but it&#8217;s definitely lower than the average credit card fee.</p>\n<p><div id="attachment_1923896" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1923896" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49203810891_495bc1ffa1_k.jpg" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1923896" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49203810891_495bc1ffa1_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49203810891_495bc1ffa1_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49203810891_495bc1ffa1_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49203810891_495bc1ffa1_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49203810891_495bc1ffa1_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49203810891_495bc1ffa1_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/49203810891_495bc1ffa1_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1923896" class="wp-caption-text">BERLIN, GERMANY &#8211; DECEMBER 11: Co-founder and CEO of Klarna Sebastian Siemiatkowski and Connie Loizos speak on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin 2019 at Arena Berlin on December 11, 2019 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch)</p></div></p>\n<p><strong>TC: Meanwhile, you&#8217;re charging merchants more than credit card companies, which you can do because you&#8217;re basically increasing their customers&#8217; purchasing power.</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Yes. If you look to some markets like Brazil and Turkey, that&#8217;s kind of how the whole world works. So in a way, that&#8217;s kind of the direction we&#8217;re heading in, because as a merchant, you&#8217;ll have more buying power than as a single individual consumer, so you&#8217;ll be able to negotiate better rates, and be able to offer these products at a better rate than this as a single individual [receives].</p>\n<p><strong>TC: Obviously you&#8217;ve heard concerns that, especially as we&#8217;re maybe heading into a recession, easy credit may be dangerous for consumers. Your technology can assess whether or not someone is a good credit risk and whether or not an attempted transaction is fraudulent, but you&#8217;re not really getting a picture of a customer&#8217;s other financial obligations or burdens.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>SS: We do thorough credit checks. It depends because it&#8217;s hard to answer these questions when you&#8217;re active in 17 markets, because they&#8217;re all different. But it&#8217;s a definite obvious for us that we need to be able to assess people&#8217;s ability to pay, as well as their intent to pay . . . We&#8217;ve been doing this for 15 years, so we really learned how to identify that and do it in a thoughtful and in a good way for the consumer.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: A lot of competitors have sprung up in recent years. Why hasn&#8217;t there been more consolidation in the space? Is it too soon?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: I think it might come eventually, but I do think again that there&#8217;s a lot of focus on these companies right now . . . and the point is that like, what we&#8217;re trying to do all of us, all these companies together, is really going after the trillion-dollar credit card industry that hasn&#8217;t served customers well, that has been all about hiding fees and hasn&#8217;t been transparent and whose products and services are fairly poor quality.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a big opportunity to change how this whole [industry works] and that&#8217;s true for us and to some degree also true for [mobile-only banks] N26 and Monzo and all the banking disruptors. We&#8217;re all going after these big banks that haven&#8217;t really served their customers well.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: It&#8217;s interesting that a lot of them are taking stakes in companies like yours. Visa made a strategic investment in Klarna in 2017. Why aren&#8217;t they pulling the trigger on more acquisitions? Is it a matter of them not knowing how to integrate these new technologies into their legacy systems but wanting at the same time to keep tabs on things?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: I genuinely think &#8212; I&#8217;ve been doing this now for 15 years, which is kind of crazy; I was 23 when we started &#8212; that the bank disruption is actually happening <em>now</em> and I&#8217;m one of the people who would never say that. I&#8217;m always like, &#8216;Oh, [something] is just a trend, it&#8217;s hype, it&#8217;s going to pass, it&#8217;s going to take longer than people expect.&#8217; But I see it happening. Consumers are switching en masse to these new services.</p>\n<p>So what the legacy incumbents can do is [choose] from three options: transform themselves, which demands a very courageous CEO to really change a business like that; secondly, M&amp;A; and third, go away and die as a company. So I do think that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to see in the market. In general, if you look at the whole industry, you&#8217;re going to see a lot of investments in M&amp;A activity going on, because that&#8217;s just how you defend yourself as as an incumbent versus disruption.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: Have you been approached?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: We get approached all the time, yeah.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: I thought it was interesting that you announced in October that AWS is now your preferred cloud provider. I imagine that Amazon is an important partner for you.</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: I&#8217;m wondering especially about Amazon given that Amazon and Google are now embedding payment systems into their platforms. How do you and your rivals [compete against them]?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: I&#8217;m [someone who] believes that sticking to core is so important and so, like, what&#8217;s happening is we&#8217;ve seen a lot of the big tech giants trying to kind of do more and more and more and more things. And I just think that&#8217;s very hard to do over time.</p>\n<p>The other thing we do at Klarna is try to consistently stay ahead. When we started 15 years ago, payments online was all about safety; that was the only thing people [cared about] because they felt unsafe shopping online. I think 2010 to 2020 has been about simplicity &#8212; one click, one click, one click &#8212; because Amazon really taught us that one click was important and everyone wants to do one click. The question is, what happens from 2020 to 2030? That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been thinking about. How do we stay ahead of the game? How do we innovate? How do we keep creating new services and improvements to consumers so that they feel that this is better than what&#8217;s out there right now.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, that really demands you to be passionate and in love with your business. And I think it&#8217;s hard for tech giants to be that at that scale. It&#8217;s easy to recognize what&#8217;s going on right now; it&#8217;s much harder [for them] to guess what&#8217;s going to happen five years from now. That really demands that passion and closeness to what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: Talking about the future, I saw that you talked to the Financial Times this summer, and when they asked you about going public after all these years, you said that, &#8220;In many ways we have most of the things in place that we need. It&#8217;s more a question of timing and focus.&#8221; So how is 2020 looking in terms of timing?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, maybe it could happen. It was kind of funny, because I was reading an interview with Michael Moritz, who&#8217;s on our board, and he was saying that we were going to stay private forever. So, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s hard for me to know what&#8217;s true anymore. People are reporting different things about Klarna.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: You never do know what Michael Moritz is going to say. But if you were to go public, I assume it would be a U.S. listing.</strong></p>\n<p>SS: I would assume so, too.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: What do you make of this whole direct listing concept that your neighbor [in Stockholm, Spotify, pioneered]?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: I think it&#8217;s wise. I mean Michael [Moritz] is a big proponent of it. I think it makes sense. I read all the arguments, and it looks interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: But you&#8217;re not raising money with direct listings &#8212; your existing shareholders are instead selling their shares on the open market &#8212; which sort of begs the question: will you be raising [another private round] of funding again? You raised a big round in summer.</strong></p>\n<p>SS: We are in a very exciting phase right now, where the U.S. and U.K. is growing so fast for us. . . And we want to continue investing. We think the potential market in in the U.S. is just massive . . . So we&#8217;ll see what happens, but I wouldn&#8217;t rule it out, that one thing that could happen is raise even more money to be investing even more in growth and product delivery, and new products and services, as well as sales and marketing in the U.S.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: Of course, every time you raise money it impacts whether or not you&#8217;re profitable. Are you profitable now? Have you ever been?</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Klarna has been profitable every year up until this year.</p>\n<p><strong>TC: That giant fundraise [in summer] kind of threw you off.</strong></p>\n<p>SS: Yeah, exactly.

Previously, he worked at Goldman Sachs and Pershing Square Capital Management.\t</div>\n\t\n\t</div>\n</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t that long ago that digitally-native, vertically-integrated brands (DNVBs) were the talk of the startup world. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture capitalists and founders watched as Warby Parker, Casper, Glossier, Harry’s and Honest Company became the belles of the D2C ball, trotting their way towards unicorn valuations. Not long after, the “startup studio” was unmasked as the elusive unicorn breeding grounds (think Hims). Today, there’s yet another buzzword that’s all the rage and it goes by the name “D2C Holding Company.” And it’s not going away anytime soon.</span></p>\n<h2>What are DNVBs?</h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, DNVBs were a game-changer. Different than e-commerce, DNVBs sell products online directly to consumers and maintain control and transparency through each stage of the production and distribution process, all without the involvement of middlemen.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This allows DNVBs to determine where and how their products are sold and to collect customer data that helps optimize their marketing strategies.\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNVBs have exploded over the last decade, growing sales and venture capital funding at a rapid pace. These brands use digital engagement strategies to create stronger relationships with consumers, which — when implemented alongside captivating content — contribute heavily to brand success by increasing customer LTV and creating compounding unit economics.</span></p>\n<h2>The problem with DNVBs</h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last three years alone, more DNVBs have launched than in the entirety of the previous decade. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this growth is encouraging, the problem is that these DNVBs are raising so much venture capital that in order to meet the return requirements of their investors, they need a significant purchase offer or IPO valuation. With more than </span><a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_1Q_2019_MA_Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">85 percent of acquisitions happening below $250 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in purchase price, strategic acquisitions offers that meet investor expectations are few and far between. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ultimately creates a state of startup purgatory where DNVBs have no choice but to take a downround to find a lifeline — sorry, Honest Company — making it difficult to develop disciplined operational habits and achieve sustainable growth. With these challenges becoming more glaringly apparent in recent years, there came a need for a new approach to D2C at large. Enter the modern D2C holding company.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Make way for the D2C holding company model</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s version of the holding company model takes what companies like Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever did in the 1950s and modernizes it for the existing D2C market. Instead of taking a siloed approach, brands pool resources, operational costs and institutional knowledge to accelerate growth and achieve profitability at a faster rate.\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNVB darlings Harry’s and Glossier are great examples of this. Harry’s diversification efforts have been centerstage as the company works to grow beyond men’s grooming to include personal care for men and women, household items and baby products. In May, Edgewell Personal Care, which owns brands like Schick, Banana Boat, and Wet Ones, acquired Harry’s for $1.37 billion. Glossier is also working to diversify its portfolio, with the launch of Glossier Play, a younger, more colorful sister brand to its original.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For DNVBs to successfully pivot to a holding company model, they will need to prioritize 1) diversification to satisfy customers’ short attention spans, 2) a data-first mindset to deliver the best possible customer experience, and 3) operational and capital efficiency to not only stay afloat, but thrive.\xa0</span></p>\n<h2><b>An evolving landscape</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landscape for D2C holding companies is just starting to take shape, but here are some of the key players who have adopted this approach and are finding early success: <div

customer experience front and center. </span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The explosion of data and identity management, combined with technical advancements in real-time signal detection and machine learning, present new opportunities to respond to consumers, but mastering this ability enables marketers to create “magic moments” — instances of hyper-relevant content, delivered at the perfect time and place.\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll see evolutions on the back end in terms of delivery and measurement — as well as on the consumer-facing end — through new creative deployments that enhance the brick-and-mortar shopping trip. Marketers will be held to a higher standard, both by clients demanding world-class performance and proof, as well as consumers who want relevancy, helpfulness and privacy from their brand relationships.\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Achieving this balance won&#8217;t be an easy task, but the most progressive marketers will succeed in driving this industry toward a more customer-centric future because they took steps to evolve before it was too late. With that in mind, here are five ways we expect advertising to become more holistic in the 2020s:\xa0</span></p>\n<h2><b>Smart data will take priority over big data</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most marketers have heard the adage, “garbage in, garbage out.” For too long, the industry relied on sheer quantity of data with no quality metrics for making key audience assumptions. This mentality has had a detrimental effect on our industry, creating an ecosystem where people simply </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/business/media/advertising-industry-research.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hate ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and brands focus on viewability over ROI.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To truly understand our audiences, we must first turn data from multi-channel interactions into smart, actionable insights. This involves not only understanding who the customer is, but what motivates them.\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive marketers will continue to invest heavily in identity graphs to tie critical data and behaviors to individual profiles across channels. Using data science and machine learning, marketers will then be able to advance their knowledge about consumers to new levels, employing new messaging tactics based not only on value, but also on what inspires action. Key nuances, like distinguishing a deal-seeker from a value-seeker, will lead to more engaging personalized experiences and ultimately better ROI for advertisers.</span></p>\n<h2><b>We’ll see a flurry of investment in real-time engagement</b></h2>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in a world where our technology predicts where we are going, what we are seeking and how long it will take to get there by recognizing our patterns and everyday behaviors. The benefits in terms of convenience and knowledge are addictive. Look no further than email, social and Alexa to see how real-time awareness and time savings from these interactions impact our everyday lives.\xa0\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For marketers, capturing this lightning in a bottle has always been elusive — until now. The rise of real-time advertising, customer data platforms (CDPs), data science and machine learning have created the ability to detect purchases as well as online and real world location signals in real-time. This enables marketers to not only predict the next shopping trip, but what a consumer is likely to buy, when it matters most.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sense-and-respond capabilities will enable progressive marketers to create experiences of enormous value at the moments that matter, such as triggering an offer of relevance upon entering a store or delivering a tailored experience at a specific time and location. The new decade will bring about massive investments into these technologies given their immediate ability to influence consumers during the actual purchase process. We’ll see budgets being specifically carved out to support real-time advertising and technologies as marketers optimize and convert users with greater effectiveness.\xa0\xa0</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For consumers, it means that the in-store experience will continue to become more interactive, with mobile devices as the connecting point between e-commerce and brick and mortar. Brands that thrive in this environment will win by delivering meaningful creative that connects both online and offline worlds in a helpful and relevant way.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Cutting-edge tech will create new ad experiences<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~4/SI3uGKsUiZQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/will-the-2020s-be-online-advertisings-holistic-decade/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '1920366', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/06/will-the-2020s-be-online-advertisings-holistic-decade/'}, {'title': 'Prolific wants to challenge Amazon’s Mechanical Turk in the online research space', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/Amazon', 'value': 'Prolific wants to challenge Amazon’s Mechanical Turk in the online research space'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/LcTi0rVWE_g/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/LcTi0rVWE_g/', 'comments': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/prolific/#respond', 'published': 'Wed, 04 Dec 2019 09:00:44 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=4, tm_hour=9, tm_min=0, tm_sec=44, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=338, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': "Steve O'Hear"}], 'author': "Steve O'Hear", 'author_detail': {'name': "Steve O'Hear"}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Europe', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Fundings & Exits', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Recent Funding', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Startups', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'TC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Amazon', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Amazon Mechanical Turk', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'computing', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'crowdsourcing', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'machine learning', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'market research', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Oxford', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Pioneer Fund', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'prolific', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Qualtrics', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'research', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Research Now', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'stanford', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'SurveyMonkey', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'TechCrunch', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'upenn', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'World Bank', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Y Combinator', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'yale', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'YouGov', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://techcrunch.com/?p=1918647', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Prolific, a U.K.-based startup that wants to make it easier to conduct online research, has raised $1.2 million in seed funding.

The idea was born out of Damer&#8217;s own frustration with existing options, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Mechanical Turk (MTurk), when carrying out research for her own PhD.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was struggling to recruit participants for my research,&#8221; she tells <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/techcrunch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="techcrunch">TechCrunch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. &#8220;None of the available tools were fit for purpose because they were either obscure, expensive or really slow! By &#8216;obscure&#8217; I mean: It wasn&#8217;t clear who the participants were, how they were treated and whether the data quality would be any good! I considered Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), the most widely used tool for academic research, but it only had U.S. American and Indian participants and a distinct lack of European ones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This led her and Bradley to create Prolific as a better alternative to MTurk, and it wasn&#8217;t long before other colleagues at Sheffield and Oxford started using the product. Just a year in, Prolific was being used by researchers globally, including those from Stanford, Oxford, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yale-security-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yale-security-inc">Yale <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and UPenn.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s grown from there almost purely through word-of-mouth, with over 3,000 customers now from researchers and companies around the world!,&#8221; says Damer.</p>\n<p>Prolific also counts the World Bank and several Fortune 500 companies as customers, and claims to reach a network of 70,000-plus active research participants from a wide range of backgrounds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that behavioural research on the internet is broken,&#8221; Damer explains. &#8220;Finding participants is difficult and slow and the data you get from other platforms is often low quality because incentives are not aligned or you&#8217;re dealing with legacy platforms that don&#8217;t leverage tech.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Customers want participants and data they can trust, but they typically have to resort to platforms which provide disengaged people who sign up for pennies. Or they even end up collecting data from fraudsters and human-assisted bots. Researchers across academia and industry are desperate for higher quality sampling solutions.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To fix these issues, Damer says that Prolific is building research technology that makes people-based research &#8220;more effective and efficient&#8221; than existing solutions, from sourcing participants, to prescreening for the right target demographics, to automating participant payments. The startup also employs what it calls proprietary user validation technology that uses statistical algorithms and machine learning to catch bots and bad actors, which Damer says plague many of the company&#8217;s competitors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually quite shocking how competitors often squeeze their participants (or &#8216;workers&#8217;) because they see them as a commodity,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;This means that participants are either disengaged or try to game the system. In contrast, we have many positive incentives built into our platform. Participants can prequalify for studies so they never get kicked out randomly, we encourage and collect two-way feedback&#8230; researchers love that they can talk to participants directly through our interface in case questions, feedback or concerns arise, and we mandate a minimum pay of $6.50 (£5) per hour. All of this creates trust and virtuous cycles that power our growth.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Damer frames Prolific&#8217;s broader mission as making &#8220;trustworthy data about people more accessible.&#8221; &#8220;Our core belief is that access to high-quality psychological and behavioural data is the foundation for great research and ultimately, for progress in business, tech, and society,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The bigger vision is to build the most powerful and flexible infrastructure for research on the internet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that Prolific doesn&#8217;t have competitors that are also attempting to make online research and insights more accessible and of better quality.</p>\n<p>Companies like CloudResearch and Positly utilise MTurk&#8217;s API, but Damer says that has limitations because &#8220;great data and great research starts with a great community,&#8221; which, <a href="https://medium.com/@ekadamer/stop-using-mturk-for-research-4b9c7b4f6f56">arguably</a>, MTurk isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>There are also well-established operations such as Nielsen, Dynata (formally <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dalsan-research" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dalsan-research">Research <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Now SSI), YouGov, Cint, IpsosMori, Qualtrics Panels and SurveyMonkey Audience, along with newer players like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/market-research-tech-startup-attest-raises-3-1m/">Attest</a> and Respondent.io.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~4/LcTi0rVWE_g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/prolific/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '1918647', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/prolific/'}, {'title': 'AWS launches managed Cassandra services', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/Amazon', 'value': 'AWS launches managed Cassandra services'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/PhfwWhOpltI/'}], 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~3/PhfwWhOpltI/', 'comments': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/aws-launches-managed-cassandra-services/#respond', 'published': 'Tue, 03 Dec 2019 18:16:00 +0000', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=3, tm_hour=18, tm_min=16, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=1, tm_yday=337, tm_isdst=0), 'authors': [{'name': 'Jonathan Shieber'}], 'author': 'Jonathan Shieber', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Jonathan Shieber'}, 'tags': [{'term': 'Developer', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'TC', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Amazon', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Amazon Neptune', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Amazon Web Services', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'apache cassandra', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'api', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'AWS', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'AWS re:Invent 2019', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'cloud infrastructure', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'cloud storage', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'data management', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'encryption', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Netflix', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'nosql', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'ooyala', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Openwave', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Reddit', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'serverless computing', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Uber', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'web hosting', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'id': 'https://techcrunch.com/?p=1919195', 'guidislink': False, 'summary': 'Today at AWS re:Invent, Amazon announced a new ability to manage Cassandra databases on AWS.

This includes the resources the pod requests in addition to a small amount of memory needed to run Kubernetes components alongside the pod. Pods running on Fargate follow the existing pricing model,” the company wrote in the blog.</p>\n<p>That means developers won’t have to worry about over provisioning because Fargate should run the exact number of resources needed to run that pod at any given moment, and no more.</p>\n<p>This feature is available starting today in U.S. East (N.

For example, the underlying infrastructure requires additional management such as optimizing for utilization, cost and performance; complying with appropriate security and regulatory requirements; and ensuring high availability and reliability,&#8221; AWS&#8217; Aditya Bindal <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-sagemaker-operators-for-kubernetes/">wrote in a blog post</a> introducing the new feature.</p>\n<p>When you combine that with the workflows associated with delivering a machine learning model inside an organization at scale, it becomes part of a much bigger delivery pipeline, one that is challenging to manage across departments and a variety of resource requirements.</p>\n<p>This is precisely what Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes has been designed to help DevOps teams do. &#8220;Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes bridges this gap, and customers are now spared all the heavy lifting of integrating their Amazon SageMaker and Kubernetes workflows. Starting today, customers using Kubernetes can make a simple call to Amazon SageMaker, a modular and fully-managed service that makes it easier to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models at scale,&#8221; Bindal wrote.</p>\n<p>The promise of Kubernetes is that it can orchestrate the delivery of containers at the right moment, but if you haven&#8217;t automated delivery of the underlying infrastructure, you can over (or under) provision and not provide the correct amount of resources required to run the job. That&#8217;s where this new tool, combined with SageMaker, can help.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With workflows in Amazon SageMaker, compute resources are pre-configured and optimized, only provisioned when requested, scaled as needed, and shut down automatically when jobs complete, offering near 100% utilization,&#8221; Bindal wrote.</p>\n<p>Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes are available today in select AWS regions.</p>\n<div class="embed breakout">\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8u90VUXU8L"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/aws-releases-sagemaker-to-make-it-easier-to-build-and-deploy-machine-learning-models/">AWS releases SageMaker to make it easier to build and deploy machine learning models</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title="&#8220;AWS releases SageMaker to make it easier to build and deploy machine learning models&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/aws-releases-sagemaker-to-make-it-easier-to-build-and-deploy-machine-learning-models/embed/#?secret=8u90VUXU8L" data-secret="8u90VUXU8L" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>\n<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws-reinvent-2019"><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/aws-reinvent-2019-banner.png"/></a></p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TechCrunch/Amazon/~4/Svl4bcKD-Sk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'wfw_commentrss': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/02/new-amazon-tool-simplifies-delivery-of-containerized-machine-learning-models/feed/', 'slash_comments': '0', 'post-id': '1918972', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/02/new-amazon-tool-simplifies-delivery-of-containerized-machine-learning-models/'}], 'bozo': 0, 'headers': {'Content-Type': 'text/xml; charset=UTF-8', 'ETag': '5P4LTvdGf/fGzs1qg6LNDA7iGaQ', 'Last-Modified': 'Thu, 19 Dec 2019 10:50:46 GMT', 'Content-Encoding': 'gzip', 'Transfer-Encoding': 'chunked', 'Date': 'Thu, 19 Dec 2019 11:54:02 GMT', 'Expires': 'Thu, 19 Dec 2019 11:54:02 GMT', 'Cache-Control': 'private, max-age=0', 'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff', 'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block', 'Server': 'GSE', 'Connection': 'close'}, 'etag': '5P4LTvdGf/fGzs1qg6LNDA7iGaQ', 'updated': 'Thu, 19 Dec 2019 10:50:46 GMT', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=19, tm_hour=10, tm_min=50, tm_sec=46, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=353, tm_isdst=0), 'href': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/Amazon', 'status': 200, 'encoding': 'UTF-8', 'version': 'rss20', 'namespaces': {'content': 'http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/', 'wfw': 'http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/', 'dc': 'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/', '': 'com-wordpress:feed-additions:1', 'sy': 'http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/', 'slash': 'http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/', 'feedburner': 'http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0'}}
