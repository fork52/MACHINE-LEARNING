 'data-type="organization" data-entity="zestmoney">ZestMoney, <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told TechCrunch in an '
 'interview that the new investment is part of an extended Series B round, the '
 '<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/22/zestmoney-raises-20m/">first '
 'tranche of which was announced in April this year</a>.</p>\\n<p>The extended '

 'data-type="organization" data-entity="zestmoney">ZestMoney&#8217;s <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> total raise to-date to $63 '
 'million, she said.</p>\\n<p>The penetration of credit cards remains very low '
 'in India; roughly three in 100 people in the country have a credit card. '
 'This has meant that very few people in the nation have a traditional credit '
 'score, which banks heavily rely on to establish one&#8217;s credit '
 'worthiness before issuing them a loan.</p>\\n<p>Moreover, small loans '
 'don&#8217;t generate lucrative returns for banks, giving them less incentive '
 'to write such cheques. In recent years, a growing number of Indian startups '
 'has stepped in to address this void.</p>\\n<p>ZestMoney assesses other data '
 'points and uses AI to help these people build a profile and become '
 'credit-worthy. The startup has\\xa0partnered with over 3,000 merchants '
 '&#8212; up from some 800 in late April &#8212; including Flipkart, <a '
 'class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" '
 'target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon, <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Paytm to offer '
 'financing options to customers at point-of-sale.</p>\\n<p>It has amassed '
 'more than 6 million users, who can access credit of $140 to $3,000. To make '
 'the deal even better, many of these merchants offer interest-free option to '
 'customers, provided they could pay back in a specified amount of '
 'time.</p>\\n<p>The startup, which maintains partnership with nearly every '
 'online payments processor in the nation including Razorpay, BillDesk, '
 'Cashfree, CCAvenue, and <a class="crunchbase-link" '
 'href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/payu-t-rkiye" target="_blank" '
 'data-type="organization" data-entity="payu-t-rkiye">PayU,\\xa0has <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> also made a push in the '
 'brick and mortar market by inking deals with <a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/xiaomi-mi-credit-india-launch/">Chinese '
 'smartphone maker Xiaomi</a>, and Pine Labs, which has deployed over 300,000 '
 'point-of-sale machines across the country.</p>\\n<p>ZestMoney has also '
 'raised an unspecified amount of debt, which it uses to finance credit to '
 'customers. It recently entered in\\xa0a strategic partnership with Credit '
 'Saison, a Japanese financial services company affiliated to Mizuho Financial '
 'Group, to deploy $100 million toward expanding digital lending in the '
 'country.</p>\\n<p>Philip Aldis, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said '
 'the firm&#8217;s investment in ZestMoney would enable more households in '
 'India to access credit. &#8220;We look forward to leveraging our global '
 'experience and network for the continued growth of ZestMoney,&#8221; he said '
 'in a statement.</p>\\n<p>Goldman Sachs has written checks to a handful of '
 'startups in India, including logistics startup\\xa0BlackBuck, home rental '
 'platform NextAway, news aggregator DailyHunt, and online furniture store '
 'PepperFry.</p>\\n<p>The New York-headquartered firm, one of the '
 'world&#8217;s largest trading banks, has also invested in a number of '
 'financial startups including NuBank, a Brazilian firm that offers digital '
 'credit card to smartphone users. It is also the <a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-apple-card-works/">banking '
 'partner for Apple Card</a>.</p>\\n<p>ZestMoney aims to disburse credit of '
 'worth $1 billion in 18 months and reach 300 million users one day. Digital '
 'lending in India is expected to be a $1 trillion opportunity in the next '
 'five years, according to Boston Consulting Group.</p>\\n<img '

 'founded by the same team that built the <a '
 'href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/01/09/ray/">Project Ray</a> '
 'open-source distributed programming framework out of UC Berkeley &#8212; '
 'Robert Nishihara, Philipp Moritz and Ion Stoica, and Berkeley professor '
 'Michael I. Jordan &#8212; has raised $20.6 million in a Series A round of '
 'funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation also from NEA, Intel '
 'Capital, Ant Financial, Amplify Partners, 11.2 Capital and The House '
 'Fund.</p>\\n<p>The company plans to use the money to build out its first '
 'commercial products &#8212; details of which are still being kept under '
 'wraps but will more generally include the ability to easily scale out a '
 'computing project from one laptop to a cluster of machines; and a group of '
 'libraries and applications to manage projects. These are expected to launch '
 'next year.</p>\\n<p><span class="s1">&#8220;Right now we are focused on '
 'making Ray a standard for building applications,&#8221; said Stoica in an '
 'interview. &#8220;The company will build tools and a runtime platform for '
 'Ray. So, if you want to run a Ray application securely and with high '
 'performance then you will use our product.&#8221;</span></p>\\n<p>The '
 'funding is partly strategic: Intel is one of the big companies that has been '
 'using Ray for its own computing projects, alongside <a '
 'class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" '
 'target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon, <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Microsoft and Ant '
 'Financial.</p>\\n<p>�Intel IT has been leveraging Ray to scale Python '
 'workloads with minimal code modifications,� said Moty Fania, principal '
 'engineer and chief technology officer for Intel IT�s Enterprise and Platform '
 'Group, in a statement. �With the implementation into Intel�s manufacturing '
 'and testing processes, we have found that Ray helps increase the speed and '
 'scale of our hyperparameter selection techniques and auto modeling processes '
 'used for creating personalized chip tests. For us, this has resulted in '
 'reduced costs, additional capacity and improved quality.�</p>\\n<p>With an '
 'impressive user list like this for the free-to-use Ray, you might ask '
 'yourself, what is the purpose of Anyscale? As Stoica and Nishihara '
 'explained, the idea will be to create simpler and easier ways to implement '
 'Ray, to make it usable whether you&#8217;re one of the Amazons of the world, '
 'or a more modest, and possibly less tech-centric operation.</p>\\n<p '
 'class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;We see that this will be valuable mostly '
 'for companies who do not have engineering experts,&#8221; Stoica said. '
 '</span></p>\\n<p>The problem that Anyscale is solving is a central one to '
 'the future of large-scale, involved computing projects: there are an '
 'increasing array of problems that are being tackled with computing '
 'solutions, but as the complexity of the work involved increases, there is a '
 'limit to how much work a single machine (even a big one) can handle. '
 '(Indeed, Anyscale cites <a class="crunchbase-link" '
 'href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/idc" target="_blank" '
 'data-type="organization" data-entity="idc">IDC <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> figures estimating that the '
 'amount of data created and copied annually will reach 175 zettabytes by '
 '2025.)</p>\\n<p>While one day there may be quantum-computing machines that '
 'can run efficiently and at scale to address these kinds of tasks, today this '
 'isn&#8217;t a realistic option, and so distributed computing has emerged as '
 'a solution.</p>\\n<p>Ray was devised as a standard to use to implement '
 'distributed computing environments, but on its own it&#8217;s too technical '
 'for the uninitiated to use.</p>\\n<p class="p1"><span '
 'class="s1">&#8220;Imagine you�re a biologist,&#8221; added Nishihara. '
 '&#8220;You can write a simple program</span><span class="s1"> and run it at '
 'a large scale, but to do that successfully you need not only to be a biology '
 'expert but a computing expert. That&#8217;s just way too high a '
 'barrier.&#8221;</span></p>\\n<p class="p1">The people behind Anyscale (and '
 'Ray) have a long and very credible list of other work behind them that '
 'speaks to the opportunities that are being spotted here. <a '
 'href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Stoica">Stoica</a>, for example, was '
 'also the co-founder of Databricks, Conviva and one of the original '
 'developers of Apache Spark.</p>\\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;I '
 'worked on Databricks with Ion and that�s how it started,&#8221; Andreessen '
 'Horowitz co-founder </span><span class="s1">Ben Horowitz said in an '
 'interview. He added that the firm has been a regular investor into projects '
 'coming out of UC Berkeley. Ray, and more specifically Anyscale, is notable '
 'for its relevance to today&#8217;s computing needs.</span></p>\\n<p '
 'class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;W</span><span class="s1">ith Ray it was a '
 'very attractive project because of the open-source metrics but also because '
 'of the issue it addresses,&#8221; he said. </span></p>\\n<p class="p1"><span '
 'class="s1">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been grappling with Moore&#8217;s Law being '
 'over, but more interestingly, it&#8217;s inadequate for things like '
 'artificial intelligence applications,&#8221; where increasing computing '
 'power is needed that outstrips what any single machine can do. '
 '&#8220;</span><span class="s1">You have to be able to deal with distributed '
 'computing, but the problem for everyone but Google is that distributed '
 'computing is hard, so we have been looking for a '
 'solution.&#8221;</span></p>\\n<img '

 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will have 50 staff going '
 'into next year. Although he said the kid-focused learn to code device '
 'business is also adding jobs in engineering and design, as well as '
 'eliminating other roles as it shifts focus.</p>\\n<p>He also suggested some '
 'of the cuts are seasonal and cyclical &#8212; related to getting through the '
 'holiday season.</p>\\n<p>Per Klein, jobs are being taking out as the company '
 'moves from building atop the Raspberry Pi platform &#8212; where it started, '
 '<a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/19/the-kano-build-it-yourself-computer-for-kids-raises-1-4m-on-kickstarter/">back '
 'in 2013</a>, with its crowdfunded DIY computer &#8212; to a Windows-based '
 'learning platform.</p>\\n<p>Other factors he pointed to in relation to the '
 'layoffs include a new manufacturing setup in China, with a &#8220;simpler, '
 'larger contract manufacturer&#8221;; fewer physical retail outlets to '
 'support, with Kano leaning more on <a class="crunchbase-link" '
 'href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" '
 'data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (which he said is '
 '&#8220;cheaper to support&#8221;); fewer dependencies on large partners and '
 'agencies, with Klein claiming 18% of US parents with kids aged 6-12 are now '
 'familiar with the brand, reducing its marketing overhead; and a desire to '
 'shrink the number of corporate managers vs makers on its books as '
 '&#8220;we&#8217;ve seen a stronger response to our first-party Kano products '
 '&#8212; Computer Kit, Pixel Kit, Motion Sensor Kit &#8212; than expected '
 'this year&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We have brought on some roles that are '
 'more focused on this new platform [Kano PC], and some roles that were '
 'focused on the Raspberry Pi are no longer with us,&#8221; he also told '
 'TechCrunch.</p>\\n<p>Kano unveiled its <a '

 'Atom-powered computer costs $300 &#8212; which puts it in the ballpark '
 'price-range of Google&#8217;s Chromebook.</p>\\n<p>The tech giant has '
 'maintained a steady focus on the educational computing market &#8212; '
 'putting a competitive squeeze on smaller players like Kano who are trying to '

 'factors such as relative repairability and attention to computing '
 'performance for the Kano PC (which he claims is &#8220;on a par with the '
 'Surface Go&#8221;), in addition to having now thrown its lot in with rival '
 'giant, Microsoft.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The more and more we got into school '
 'environments the more and more we were in conversations with major North '
 'American distributors to schools, the more we saw that people wanted that '
 '&#8216;DIY&#8217;&#8230; product design, they wanted the hackability and '
 'extensibility of the kit, they wanted the tools to be open source and '
 'manipulable but they also wanted to be able to run Photoshop and to run '
 'Class Dashboard and to run <a class="crunchbase-link" '
 'href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" '
 'data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Office. And so that was '
 'when we struck the partnership with Microsoft,&#8221; said '
 'Klein.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The Windows computer is packed with content and '
 'curriculum for teachers and an integration with Microsoft Teams which '
 'requires a different sort of development capability,&#8221; he '
 'added.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The roles we&#8217;re adding are around subscription, '
 'they&#8217;re around the computer, building new applications and tools for '
 'the computer and continuing to enrich the number of projects that are '
 'available for our members now &#8212; so we&#8217;re doing things like '
 'allowing people to connect the sensors in their wands to household IoT '
 'devices. We&#8217;re introducing, over the Christmas period, a new '
 'collaborative drawing app.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>According to Klein, Kano is '
 '&#8220;already seeing demand for 60,000 units in this next calendar '
 'year&#8221; for its Windows-based PC &#8212; which he said is &#8220;well '
 'beyond what we expect&#8230; given the price-point&#8221;.</p>\\n<p>Although '
 'he did not put a figure on exact sales to date of the Kano PC.</p>\\n<p>He '
 'also\\xa0<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: '
 '-0.1px;">confirmed </span>Kano will be dialling back the range of products '
 'it offers next year.</p>\\n<p>It recently emerged that an own-brand camera '
 'device, which Kano first trailed back in <a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/kano-moves-beyond-pi-with-code-your-own-device-kits-for-kids/">2016</a>, '
 'will not now be shipping. Klein also told us that another co-branded Disney '
 'product they&#8217;d been planning for 2020 is being &#8220;put back&#8221; '
 '&#8212; with no new date for release as yet.</p>\\n<p>Klein denied sales '
 'have been lacklustre &#8212; claiming the current <a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/kano-will-start-releasing-star-wars-and-other-disney-branded-products-later-this-year/"><em>Star '
 'War</em>s and <em>Frozen</em> e-products</a> have &#8220;done enough for '
 'us&#8221;. (While a co-branded <em>Harry Potter</em> e-wand is selling '
 'faster than expected, per Klein, who said they had expected to have stock '
 'until March but are &#8220;selling out&#8221;.)</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The '
 'reorganization we&#8217;ve done has nothing to do with growth and '
 'users,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;We are on track to sell through more units '
 'as well as products at a higher average selling price this fiscal year. '
 'We&#8217;re selling out of wands when we expected to have stock all the way '
 'to March. We have more pre-launch demand for the Kano PC than anything '
 'we&#8217;ve ever done.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Of the additional, co-branded Disney '
 'e-product which is being delayed &#8212; and may not now launch at all next '
 'year &#8212; Klein told us: &#8220;The fact is we&#8217;re in negotiations '
 'with Disney around this &#8212; and around the timing of it. Given that '
 'we&#8217;re not certain we&#8217;re going to be doing it in 2020 some of the '
 'contractor roles in particular that we brought on to do the licensing sign '
 'off pieces, to develop some of the content around those brands, some of the '
 'apparatus set up to manage those partnerships &#8212; we don&#8217;t need '
 'any more.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We introduced three new hardware SKUs this '
 'year. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll do three new hardware SKUs next '
 'year,&#8221; he added, confirming the intention is to trim the number of '
 'device launches in 2020 to focus on the Kano PC.</p>\\n<p>One source we '
 'spoke to suggested Kano is considering sunsetting its partner strategy '
 'entirely. However Klein did not go that far in his comments to '
 'us.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been riding a certain bear for a few years. '
 'We&#8217;re jumping to a new bear. That&#8217;s always going to create a bit '
 'of exhilaration. But I think this is a place of real promise,&#8221; was how '
 'he couched the pivot.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I think what Kano does better than '
 'anyone else in the world is crafting an experience around technology that '
 'opens up its attributes to a wider audience,&#8221; Klein also said when '
 'asked whether hardware or software will be its main focus going forward. '
 '&#8220;The hardware element is crucial and beautiful and we make some of the '
 'world&#8217;s most interesting dynamic physical products. It&#8217;s an '
 'often told story that hardware&#8217;s very hard and is brutal &#8212; and '
 'yeah, because if you get it right you change the fabric of '
 'society.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard for me to draw a line between '
 'hardware and software for the business because we&#8217;ve always been asked '
 'that and seven years into the business we&#8217;ve found the greatest things '
 'that people do with the products&#8230; it&#8217;s always when there&#8217;s '
 'a combination of the two. So we&#8217;re proud that we&#8217;re good at '
 'combining the two and we&#8217;re going to continue to do '
 'it.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>The STEM device space has been going through bumpy times '
 'in recent years as early hype and investment has failed to translate into '
 'sustained revenues at every twist and turn.</p>\\n<p>The category is '
 'certainly filled with challenges &#8212; from low barrier to entry leading '
 'to plentiful (if varied quality) competition, to the demands of building '
 'safe, robust and appealing products for (fickle) kids that tightly and '
 'reliably integrate hardware and software, to checking all the relevant boxes '
 'and processes to win over teachers and support schools&#8217; curriculum '
 'requirements that&#8217;s essential for selling direct to the education '
 'market.</p>\\n<p>Given so many demands on STEM device makers it&#8217;s not '
 'surprising this year has seen a number of these startups exiting to other '
 'players and/or larger electronics makers &#8212; such as <a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/23/sphero-is-buying-littlebits/">Sphero '
 'picking up littleBits</a>. A <a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/sphero-lays-off-dozens-as-it-shifts-focus-to-education/">couple '
 'of years ago</a> Sphero went through its own pivot <a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/sphero-is-finished-making-star-wars-products/">away '
 'from selling co-branded Disney</a> &#8216;learn to code&#8217; gizmos to '
 'zoom in on the education space.</p>\\n<p>While another UK-based STEM device '
 'maker &#8212; <a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/reliability-concerns-raised-over-pi-tops-stem-learning-laptop/">pi-top</a> '
 '&#8212; has also been <a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/london-edtech-startup-pi-top-sees-layoffs-after-major-contract-loss/">through</a> '
 '<a '
 'href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/more-layoffs-at-pivoting-london-edtech-startup-pi-top/">several '
 'rounds of layoffs</a> recently, apparently as part of its own pivot to the '
 'U.S. edtech market.</p>\\n<p>More consolidation in the category seems highly '
 'likely. And given the new relationship between Kano and Microsoft joining '
 'Redmond, via acquisition, may be the obvious end point for the '
 'startup.</p>\\n<p>Per the <em>Telegraph</em>&#8216;s report, Kano is in the '
 'process of looking to raise more funding. However Klein did not comment when '
 'asked to confirm the company&#8217;s funding situation.</p>\\n<p>The startup '
 'last reported a raise just over <a '

 'tech hub in Berlin that will house 500 employees in product and engineering. '
 'But we were far more interested in discussing the future of the company, '
 'which is best known for providing instant credit to online shoppers at the '
 'point of checkout and is growing fast, with nearly 3,000 employees across 17 '
 'countries. Klarna has also begun competing more aggressively in the U.S. '

 'Levchin&#8217;s <a href="https://www.affirm.com/">Affirm </a>to <a '
 'href="https://sezzle.com/">Sezzle</a>, a company in Minneapolis that '
 'seemingly appeared from out of the blue a few years ago.</p>\\n<p>Of course, '
 'the toughest competition of all may come from <a class="crunchbase-link" '
 'href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" '
 'data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Google, which are '
 'increasingly embedding their payment systems &#8212; Amazon Pay and and '
 'Google Pay &#8212; into the sites of merchants. We talked with Siemiatkowski '
 'about how <a class="crunchbase-link" '
 'href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/klarna" target="_blank" '
 'data-type="organization" data-entity="klarna">Klarna <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> survives as they gobble up '
 'more of the retail industry. We also asked about whether Amazon might be an '
 'acquirer, or whether Klarna might be eyeing an IPO in 2020 instead. You can '
 'check out our conversation below. It has been lightly edited for length and '
 'clarity.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: The last time we sat down together was four '
 'years or so ago, when Klarna was best known for its checkout product. What '
 'are some of the ways in which the company has evolved since '
 'then?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: There&#8217;s a massive opportunity. For '
 'consumers, when they shop online today, they have so many friction points. '
 'One of them might be the ability to get free credit without all the fees and '
 'things that people associate with credit cards. But there&#8217;s also other '
 'things like, where&#8217;s my package? When will it arrive? How do I do '
 'returns? Where are the best offers? Where are the best discounts? '
 'There&#8217;s a lot of things that people still struggle with. And so what '
 'we&#8217;re trying to do is create that super-smooth shopping experience, '
 'and the more problems we solve for these customers, the better, and the '
 'happier they are, and the more they&#8217;re going to use '
 'it.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: Do you have any other financial products, like '
 '[longer-term] loans?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: We do direct type of payments '
 'like that. And then, in some countries here in Europe, we&#8217;ve already '
 'launched a plastic card, as well. So you can use this like that. And then we '
 'also do this kind of Mint.com-like financial dashboard that shows you your '
 'spending habits, and all that kind of stuff.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: '
 'You&#8217;re adding this hub in Berlin, but you&#8217;re already in '
 'Germany&#8211;</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Yes, Germany is actually our largest '
 'market. In Germany, we have about 30 million users, which, you know, takes '
 'us about 10 million ahead of that American wallet thing [<a '
 'class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" '
 'target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal], <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which is quite cool. So '
 'Germany is super important for us, but right now what&#8217;s exciting is '
 'the U.S., so right now we&#8217;re adding customers at a pace that will be '
 'about six million customers on an annual basis right now. So the U.S. is '
 'really taking off.</p>\\n<p><div id="attachment_1923897" style="width: '

 'product is still the biggest producer of revenue?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Yes. '
 'If you look at those two things going on here, first is that millennials, in '
 'the U.S. and U.K., they don&#8217;t have credit cards, they have debit cards '
 '&#8212; 70% of millennials in the U.S. only have debit cards. But '
 'they&#8217;re still looking sometimes to get a cash flow ease. What&#8217;s '
 'good about our services is it doesn&#8217;t cost a consumer anything, so '
 'it&#8217;s not like the old credit cards, which were really expensive for '
 'users.</p>\\n<p>It&#8217;s merchant-funded, so that allows the consumers to '
 'then sometimes be able to either ease their cash flow by paying in four '
 'installments, or try before they buy [meaning they can defer the payment for '
 'some period] and stuff like. People forget that people who have debit cards '
 'have much harder issues shopping online than people with credit cards, and '
 'that&#8217;s a big piece of what we&#8217;re solving '
 'for.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: Do you always break the payments into four '
 'installments? Do you customize these plans?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Breaking '
 '[into] four [payments] is great and that&#8217;s one option. What '
 'we&#8217;ve seen is that consumers have different needs, so some people '
 'really like our try-before-you-buy product [where] you pay nothing at the '
 'time but then [pay] everything 30 days later when you receive the products. '
 'Sometimes, if it&#8217;s a bigger purchase, like you&#8217;re buying a sofa '
 'or something, you split it over 24 months of financing or something like '
 'that, which is kind of different. And sometimes people just want to pay for '
 'everything instantly. So we just want to make sure that people have all the '
 'options that they want.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: How much can users spend? '
 'What&#8217;s the upper boundary?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: I&#8217;m sure there '
 'is one but it&#8217;s really hard to answer because it&#8217;s very '
 'individual, on an individual basis.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: And to be clear, '
 'you&#8217;re buying these receivables from merchants at a discount? Is that '
 'how it works?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Basically, the merchant sets up with us, '
 'they pay us a merchant fee just like they do with PayPal or somebody else. '
 'Then we process the payments for them, and we take the full risk, and all '
 'the customer care and everything related to the '
 'transaction.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re not using '
 'your [venture funding] to do this. You have a bank charter in Sweden . . '
 '.</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Yes, we&#8217;re a fully licensed bank and we have '
 'deposits to fund the balance sheet. So people in Germany can actually save '
 'with Klarna and get 1%, which doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but it&#8217;s '
 'massively more than they get with any of the traditional banks in '
 'Germany.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: What about interest fees and late fees? How do '
 'those work?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Basically, we keep them extremely low. '
 'There are sometimes if you&#8217;re late, there might be a late fee, but the '
 'whole purpose here is that it&#8217;s merchant-funded. So merchants pay for '
 'this, and the consumers get a much better product than the traditional '
 'credit card or other options.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the default '
 'rate?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Super low. If you look at overall Klarna, for '
 'all markets, it&#8217;s less than 1%.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: There is a '
 'competitor of yours, AfterPay, that was criticized last year because '
 'something like a quarter of its revenue was coming from late payments. Where '
 '[is your revenue coming from]?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Most of it is coming '
 'from merchant fees, and late fees in general are never bigger than the '
 'losses that you&#8217;re making. But I think it&#8217;s definitely an '
 'important topic, where all the companies in this industry need to be very '
 'careful about how you set up your products.</p>\\n<p>I think Klarna &#8212; '
 'maybe because we&#8217;ve been around longer than the competitor '
 'you&#8217;re referring to and because we&#8217;re five times their size in '
 'totality &#8212; maybe we have just come a little bit further in how we '
 'think about consumer value and making sure that fees are right and so forth. '
 'So those are important topics to keep an eye on. But I also think that '
 'what&#8217;s even more important is that you have this credit card industry, '
 'which in general has charged massive interest rates, a lot of late fees, and '
 'been not a very transparent and great industry. And I think, actually, the '
 'big opportunity is for people like us, and the one you refer to and others, '
 'to disrupt that industry. It&#8217;s the credit card industry that '
 'we&#8217;re going after.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: Sure, and I&#8217;m not going '
 'to defend the credit card industry, but did you say what your interest fees '
 'are?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: It depends on an individual basis, but it&#8217;s '
 'definitely lower than the average credit card fee.</p>\\n<p><div '

 'you&#8217;re charging merchants more than credit card companies, which you '
 'can do because you&#8217;re basically increasing their customers&#8217; '
 'purchasing power.</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Yes. If you look to some markets '
 'like Brazil and Turkey, that&#8217;s kind of how the whole world works. So '
 'in a way, that&#8217;s kind of the direction we&#8217;re heading in, because '
 'as a merchant, you&#8217;ll have more buying power than as a single '
 'individual consumer, so you&#8217;ll be able to negotiate better rates, and '
 'be able to offer these products at a better rate than this as a single '
 'individual [receives].</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: Obviously you&#8217;ve heard '
 'concerns that, especially as we&#8217;re maybe heading into a recession, '
 'easy credit may be dangerous for consumers. Your technology can assess '
 'whether or not someone is a good credit risk and whether or not an attempted '
 'transaction is fraudulent, but you&#8217;re not really getting a picture of '
 'a customer&#8217;s other financial obligations or '
 'burdens.&nbsp;</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: We do thorough credit checks. It '
 'depends because it&#8217;s hard to answer these questions when you&#8217;re '
 'active in 17 markets, because they&#8217;re all different. But it&#8217;s a '
 'definite obvious for us that we need to be able to assess people&#8217;s '
 'ability to pay, as well as their intent to pay . . . We&#8217;ve been doing '
 'this for 15 years, so we really learned how to identify that and do it in a '
 'thoughtful and in a good way for the consumer.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: A lot of '
 'competitors have sprung up in recent years. Why hasn&#8217;t there been more '
 'consolidation in the space? Is it too soon?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: I think it '
 'might come eventually, but I do think again that there&#8217;s a lot of '
 'focus on these companies right now . . . and the point is that like, what '
 'we&#8217;re trying to do all of us, all these companies together, is really '
 'going after the trillion-dollar credit card industry that hasn&#8217;t '
 'served customers well, that has been all about hiding fees and hasn&#8217;t '
 'been transparent and whose products and services are fairly poor '
 'quality.</p>\\n<p>There&#8217;s a big opportunity to change how this whole '
 '[industry works] and that&#8217;s true for us and to some degree also true '
 'for [mobile-only banks] N26 and Monzo and all the banking disruptors. '
 'We&#8217;re all going after these big banks that haven&#8217;t really served '
 'their customers well.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: It&#8217;s interesting that a lot '
 'of them are taking stakes in companies like yours. Visa made a strategic '
 'investment in Klarna in 2017. Why aren&#8217;t they pulling the trigger on '
 'more acquisitions? Is it a matter of them not knowing how to integrate these '
 'new technologies into their legacy systems but wanting at the same time to '
 'keep tabs on things?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: I genuinely think &#8212; '
 'I&#8217;ve been doing this now for 15 years, which is kind of crazy; I was '
 '23 when we started &#8212; that the bank disruption is actually happening '
 '<em>now</em> and I&#8217;m one of the people who would never say that. '
 'I&#8217;m always like, &#8216;Oh, [something] is just a trend, it&#8217;s '
 'hype, it&#8217;s going to pass, it&#8217;s going to take longer than people '
 'expect.&#8217; But I see it happening. Consumers are switching en masse to '
 'these new services.</p>\\n<p>So what the legacy incumbents can do is '
 '[choose] from three options: transform themselves, which demands a very '
 'courageous CEO to really change a business like that; secondly, M&amp;A; and '
 'third, go away and die as a company. So I do think that&#8217;s what '
 'you&#8217;re going to see in the market. In general, if you look at the '
 'whole industry, you&#8217;re going to see a lot of investments in M&amp;A '
 'activity going on, because that&#8217;s just how you defend yourself as as '
 'an incumbent versus disruption.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: Have you been '
 'approached?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: We get approached all the time, '
 'yeah.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: I thought it was interesting that you announced '
 'in October that AWS is now your preferred cloud provider. I imagine that '
 'Amazon is an important partner for you.</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: '
 'Yes.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: I&#8217;m wondering especially about Amazon given '
 'that Amazon and Google are now embedding payment systems into their '
 'platforms. How do you and your rivals [compete against '
 'them]?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: I&#8217;m [someone who] believes that sticking '
 'to core is so important and so, like, what&#8217;s happening is we&#8217;ve '
 'seen a lot of the big tech giants trying to kind of do more and more and '
 'more and more things. And I just think that&#8217;s very hard to do over '
 'time.</p>\\n<p>The other thing we do at Klarna is try to consistently stay '
 'ahead. When we started 15 years ago, payments online was all about safety; '
 'that was the only thing people [cared about] because they felt unsafe '
 'shopping online. I think 2010 to 2020 has been about simplicity &#8212; one '
 'click, one click, one click &#8212; because Amazon really taught us that one '
 'click was important and everyone wants to do one click. The question is, '
 'what happens from 2020 to 2030? That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been thinking '
 'about. How do we stay ahead of the game? How do we innovate? How do we keep '
 'creating new services and improvements to consumers so that they feel that '
 'this is better than what&#8217;s out there right now.</p>\\n<p>In my '
 'opinion, that really demands you to be passionate and in love with your '
 'business. And I think it&#8217;s hard for tech giants to be that at that '
 'scale. It&#8217;s easy to recognize what&#8217;s going on right now; '
 'it&#8217;s much harder [for them] to guess what&#8217;s going to happen five '
 'years from now. That really demands that passion and closeness to what '
 'you&#8217;re doing.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: Talking about the future, I saw '
 'that you talked to the Financial Times this summer, and when they asked you '
 'about going public after all these years, you said that, &#8220;In many ways '
 'we have most of the things in place that we need. It&#8217;s more a question '
 'of timing and focus.&#8221; So how is 2020 looking in terms of '
 'timing?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, maybe it could '
 'happen. It was kind of funny, because I was reading an interview with '
 'Michael Moritz, who&#8217;s on our board, and he was saying that we were '
 'going to stay private forever. So, I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s hard for '
 'me to know what&#8217;s true anymore. People are reporting different things '
 'about Klarna.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: You never do know what Michael Moritz is '
 'going to say. But if you were to go public, I assume it would be a U.S. '
 'listing.</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: I would assume so, too.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: '
 'What do you make of this whole direct listing concept that your neighbor [in '
 'Stockholm, Spotify, pioneered]?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: I think it&#8217;s '
 'wise. I mean Michael [Moritz] is a big proponent of it. I think it makes '
 'sense. I read all the arguments, and it looks '
 'interesting.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: But you&#8217;re not raising money with '
 'direct listings &#8212; your existing shareholders are instead selling their '
 'shares on the open market &#8212; which sort of begs the question: will you '
 'be raising [another private round] of funding again? You raised a big round '
 'in summer.</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: We are in a very exciting phase right now, '
 'where the U.S. and U.K. is growing so fast for us. . . And we want to '
 'continue investing. We think the potential market in in the U.S. is just '
 'massive . . . So we&#8217;ll see what happens, but I wouldn&#8217;t rule it '
 'out, that one thing that could happen is raise even more money to be '
 'investing even more in growth and product delivery, and new products and '
 'services, as well as sales and marketing in the U.S.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: Of '
 'course, every time you raise money it impacts whether or not you&#8217;re '
 'profitable. Are you profitable now? Have you ever '
 'been?</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Klarna has been profitable every year up until '
 'this year.</p>\\n<p><strong>TC: That giant fundraise [in summer] kind of '
 'threw you off.</strong></p>\\n<p>SS: Yeah, exactly. '

 'id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn�t that long '
 'ago that digitally-native, vertically-integrated brands (DNVBs) were the '
 'talk of the startup world. </span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: '
 '400;">Venture capitalists and founders watched as Warby Parker, Casper, '
 'Glossier, Harry�s and Honest Company became the belles of the D2C ball, '
 'trotting their way towards unicorn valuations. Not long after, the �startup '
 'studio� was unmasked as the elusive unicorn breeding grounds (think Hims). '
 'Today, there�s yet another buzzword that�s all the rage and it goes by the '
 'name �D2C Holding Company.� And it�s not going away anytime '
 'soon.</span></p>\\n<h2>What are DNVBs?</h2>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: '
 '400;">In 2017, DNVBs were a game-changer. Different than e-commerce, DNVBs '
 'sell products online directly to consumers and maintain control and '
 'transparency through each stage of the production and distribution process, '
 'all without the involvement of middlemen.</span> <span style="font-weight: '
 '400;">This allows DNVBs to determine where and how their products are sold '
 'and to collect customer data that helps optimize their marketing '
 'strategies.\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNVBs have '
 'exploded over the last decade, growing sales and venture capital funding at '
 'a rapid pace. These brands use digital engagement strategies to create '
 'stronger relationships with consumers, which � when implemented alongside '
 'captivating content � contribute heavily to brand success by increasing '
 'customer LTV and creating compounding unit economics.</span></p>\\n<h2>The '
 'problem with DNVBs</h2>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last '
 'three years alone, more DNVBs have launched than in the entirety of the '
 'previous decade. </span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this '
 'growth is encouraging, the problem is that these DNVBs are raising so much '
 'venture capital that in order to meet the return requirements of their '
 'investors, they need a significant purchase offer or IPO valuation. With '
 'more than </span><a '
 'href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_1Q_2019_MA_Report.pdf"><span '
 'style="font-weight: 400;">85 percent of acquisitions happening below $250 '
 'million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in purchase price, '
 'strategic acquisitions offers that meet investor expectations are few and '
 'far between. </span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This '
 'ultimately creates a state of startup purgatory where DNVBs have no choice '
 'but to take a downround to find a lifeline � sorry, Honest Company � making '
 'it difficult to develop disciplined operational habits and achieve '
 'sustainable growth. With these challenges becoming more glaringly apparent '
 'in recent years, there came a need for a new approach to D2C at large. Enter '
 'the modern D2C holding company.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Make way for the D2C '
 'holding company model</b></h2>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today�s '
 'version of the holding company model takes what companies like Procter &amp; '
 'Gamble and Unilever did in the 1950s and modernizes it for the existing D2C '
 'market. Instead of taking a siloed approach, brands pool resources, '
 'operational costs and institutional knowledge to accelerate growth and '
 'achieve profitability at a faster rate.\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span '
 'style="font-weight: 400;">DNVB darlings Harry�s and Glossier are great '
 'examples of this. Harry�s diversification efforts have been centerstage as '
 'the company works to grow beyond men�s grooming to include personal care for '
 'men and women, household items and baby products. In May, Edgewell Personal '
 'Care, which owns brands like Schick, Banana Boat, and Wet Ones, acquired '
 'Harry�s for $1.37 billion. Glossier is also working to diversify its '
 'portfolio, with the launch of Glossier Play, a younger, more colorful sister '
 'brand to its original.</span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For '
 'DNVBs to successfully pivot to a holding company model, they will need to '
 'prioritize 1) diversification to satisfy customers� short attention spans, '
 '2) a data-first mindset to deliver the best possible customer experience, '
 'and 3) operational and capital efficiency to not only stay afloat, but '
 'thrive.\\xa0</span></p>\\n<h2><b>An evolving landscape</b></h2>\\n<p><span '
 'style="font-weight: 400;">The landscape for D2C holding companies is just '
 'starting to take shape, but here are some of the key players who have '
 'adopted this approach and are finding early success: <div '

 'style="font-weight: 400;">With less than two months left in the decade, '
 'advertising is again entering a new phase of rapid expansion with customer '
 'experience front and center. </span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: '
 '400;">The explosion of data and identity management, combined with technical '
 'advancements in real-time signal detection and machine learning, present new '
 'opportunities to respond to consumers, but mastering this ability enables '
 'marketers to create �magic moments� � instances of hyper-relevant content, '
 'delivered at the perfect time and place.\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span '
 'style="font-weight: 400;">We�ll see evolutions on the back end in terms of '
 'delivery and measurement � as well as on the consumer-facing end � through '
 'new creative deployments that enhance the brick-and-mortar shopping trip. '
 'Marketers will be held to a higher standard, both by clients demanding '
 'world-class performance and proof, as well as consumers who want relevancy, '
 'helpfulness and privacy from their brand '
 'relationships.\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: '
 '400;">Achieving this balance won&#8217;t be an easy task, but the most '
 'progressive marketers will succeed in driving this industry toward a more '
 'customer-centric future because they took steps to evolve before it was too '
 'late. With that in mind, here are five ways we expect advertising to become '
 'more holistic in the 2020s:\\xa0</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Smart data will take '
 'priority over big data</b></h2>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most '
 'marketers have heard the adage, �garbage in, garbage out.� For too long, the '
 'industry relied on sheer quantity of data with no quality metrics for making '
 'key audience assumptions. This mentality has had a detrimental effect on our '
 'industry, creating an ecosystem where people simply </span><a '
 'href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/business/media/advertising-industry-research.html"><span '
 'style="font-weight: 400;">hate ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: '
 '400;"> and brands focus on viewability over ROI.</span></p>\\n<p><span '
 'style="font-weight: 400;">To truly understand our audiences, we must first '
 'turn data from multi-channel interactions into smart, actionable insights. '
 'This involves not only understanding who the customer is, but what motivates '
 'them.\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive '
 'marketers will continue to invest heavily in identity graphs to tie critical '
 'data and behaviors to individual profiles across channels. Using data '
 'science and machine learning, marketers will then be able to advance their '
 'knowledge about consumers to new levels, employing new messaging tactics '
 'based not only on value, but also on what inspires action. Key nuances, like '
 'distinguishing a deal-seeker from a value-seeker, will lead to more engaging '
 'personalized experiences and ultimately better ROI for '
 'advertisers.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>We�ll see a flurry of investment in '
 'real-time engagement</b></h2>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live '
 'in a world where our technology predicts where we are going, what we are '
 'seeking and how long it will take to get there by recognizing our patterns '
 'and everyday behaviors. The benefits in terms of convenience and knowledge '
 'are addictive. Look no further than email, social and Alexa to see how '
 'real-time awareness and time savings from these interactions impact our '
 'everyday lives.\\xa0\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: '
 '400;">For marketers, capturing this lightning in a bottle has always been '
 'elusive � until now. The rise of real-time advertising, customer data '
 'platforms (CDPs), data science and machine learning have created the ability '
 'to detect purchases as well as online and real world location signals in '
 'real-time. This enables marketers to not only predict the next shopping '
 'trip, but what a consumer is likely to buy, when it matters '
 'most.</span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These '
 'sense-and-respond capabilities will enable progressive marketers to create '
 'experiences of enormous value at the moments that matter, such as triggering '
 'an offer of relevance upon entering a store or delivering a tailored '
 'experience at a specific time and location. The new decade will bring about '
 'massive investments into these technologies given their immediate ability to '
 'influence consumers during the actual purchase process. We�ll see budgets '
 'being specifically carved out to support real-time advertising and '
 'technologies as marketers optimize and convert users with greater '
 'effectiveness.\\xa0\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For '
 'consumers, it means that the in-store experience will continue to become '
 'more interactive, with mobile devices as the connecting point between '
 'e-commerce and brick and mortar. Brands that thrive in this environment will '
 'win by delivering meaningful creative that connects both online and offline '
 'worlds in a helpful and relevant way.</span></p>\\n<h2><b>Cutting-edge tech '

 'demo day</a> this past summer.</p>\\n<p>Founded in 2014 by Ekaterina Damer '
 'and Phelim Bradley, doctoral students at Sheffield and Oxford universities, '
 'respectively, at the time, Prolific offers an online tool to easily recruit '
 'and pay research participants and conduct what it calls &#8220;ethical and '
 'trustworthy&#8221; research. The idea was born out of Damer&#8217;s own '
 'frustration with existing options, including <a class="crunchbase-link" '
 'href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" '
 'data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon�s <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Mechanical Turk (MTurk), '
 'when carrying out research for her own PhD.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;I was struggling '
 'to recruit participants for my research,&#8221; she tells <a '
 'class="crunchbase-link" '
 'href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/techcrunch" target="_blank" '
 'data-type="organization" data-entity="techcrunch">TechCrunch <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. &#8220;None of the '
 'available tools were fit for purpose because they were either obscure, '
 'expensive or really slow! By &#8216;obscure&#8217; I mean: It wasn&#8217;t '
 'clear who the participants were, how they were treated and whether the data '
 'quality would be any good! I considered Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk '
 '(MTurk), the most widely used tool for academic research, but it only had '
 'U.S. American and Indian participants and a distinct lack of European '
 'ones.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>This led her and Bradley to create Prolific as a '
 'better alternative to MTurk, and it wasn&#8217;t long before other '
 'colleagues at Sheffield and Oxford started using the product. Just a year '
 'in, Prolific was being used by researchers globally, including those from '
 'Stanford, Oxford, <a class="crunchbase-link" '
 'href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yale-security-inc" target="_blank" '
 'data-type="organization" data-entity="yale-security-inc">Yale <span '
 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and '
 'UPenn.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s grown from there almost purely through '
 'word-of-mouth, with over 3,000 customers now from researchers and companies '
 'around the world!,&#8221; says Damer.</p>\\n<p>Prolific also counts the '
 'World Bank and several Fortune 500 companies as customers, and claims to '
 'reach a network of 70,000-plus active research participants from a wide '
 'range of backgrounds.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;The problem is that behavioural '
 'research on the internet is broken,&#8221; Damer explains. &#8220;Finding '
 'participants is difficult and slow and the data you get from other platforms '
 'is often low quality because incentives are not aligned or you&#8217;re '
 'dealing with legacy platforms that don&#8217;t leverage '
 'tech.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Customers want participants and data they can trust, '
 'but they typically have to resort to platforms which provide disengaged '
 'people who sign up for pennies. Or they even end up collecting data from '
 'fraudsters and human-assisted bots. Researchers across academia and industry '
 'are desperate for higher quality sampling solutions.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>To fix '
 'these issues, Damer says that Prolific is building research technology that '
 'makes people-based research &#8220;more effective and efficient&#8221; than '
 'existing solutions, from sourcing participants, to prescreening for the '
 'right target demographics, to automating participant payments. The startup '
 'also employs what it calls proprietary user validation technology that uses '
 'statistical algorithms and machine learning to catch bots and bad actors, '
 'which Damer says plague many of the company&#8217;s '
 'competitors.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually quite shocking how '
 'competitors often squeeze their participants (or &#8216;workers&#8217;) '
 'because they see them as a commodity,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;This means '
 'that participants are either disengaged or try to game the system. In '
 'contrast, we have many positive incentives built into our platform. '
 'Participants can prequalify for studies so they never get kicked out '
 'randomly, we encourage and collect two-way feedback&#8230; researchers love '
 'that they can talk to participants directly through our interface in case '
 'questions, feedback or concerns arise, and we mandate a minimum pay of $6.50 '
 '(�5) per hour. All of this creates trust and virtuous cycles that power our '
 'growth.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Damer frames Prolific&#8217;s broader mission as '
 'making &#8220;trustworthy data about people more accessible.&#8221; '
 '&#8220;Our core belief is that access to high-quality psychological and '
 'behavioural data is the foundation for great research and ultimately, for '
 'progress in business, tech, and society,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The bigger '
 'vision is to build the most powerful and flexible infrastructure for '
 'research on the internet.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that '
 'Prolific doesn&#8217;t have competitors that are also attempting to make '
 'online research and insights more accessible and of better '
 'quality.</p>\\n<p>Companies like CloudResearch and Positly utilise '
 'MTurk&#8217;s API, but Damer says that has limitations because &#8220;great '
 'data and great research starts with a great community,&#8221; which, <a '
 'href="https://medium.com/@ekadamer/stop-using-mturk-for-research-4b9c7b4f6f56">arguably</a>, '
 'MTurk isn&#8217;t.</p>\\n<p>There are also well-established operations such '

 'memory resources that your pod needs to run. This includes the resources the '
 'pod requests in addition to a small amount of memory needed to run '
 'Kubernetes components alongside the pod. Pods running on Fargate follow the '
 'existing pricing model,� the company wrote in the blog.</p>\\n<p>That means '
 'developers won�t have to worry about over provisioning because Fargate '

 'class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> SageMaker Operators for '
 'Kubernetes is supposed to make it easier to run and manage those containers, '
 'the underlying infrastructure needed to run the models and the workflows '
 'associated with all of it.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;While Kubernetes gives customers '
 'control and portability, running ML workloads on a Kubernetes cluster brings '
 'unique challenges. For example, the underlying infrastructure requires '
 'additional management such as optimizing for utilization, cost and '
 'performance; complying with appropriate security and regulatory '
 'requirements; and ensuring high availability and reliability,&#8221; '
 'AWS&#8217; Aditya Bindal <a '
 'href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-amazon-sagemaker-operators-for-kubernetes/">wrote '
 'in a blog post</a> introducing the new feature.</p>\\n<p>When you combine '
 'that with the workflows associated with delivering a machine learning model '
 'inside an organization at scale, it becomes part of a much bigger delivery '
 'pipeline, one that is challenging to manage across departments and a variety '
 'of resource requirements.</p>\\n<p>This is precisely what Amazon SageMaker '
 'Operators for Kubernetes has been designed to help DevOps teams do. '
 '&#8220;Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes bridges this gap, and '
 'customers are now spared all the heavy lifting of integrating their Amazon '
 'SageMaker and Kubernetes workflows. Starting today, customers using '
 'Kubernetes can make a simple call to Amazon SageMaker, a modular and '
 'fully-managed service that makes it easier to build, train, and deploy '
 'machine learning (ML) models at scale,&#8221; Bindal wrote.</p>\\n<p>The '
 'promise of Kubernetes is that it can orchestrate the delivery of containers '
 'at the right moment, but if you haven&#8217;t automated delivery of the '
 'underlying infrastructure, you can over (or under) provision and not provide '
 'the correct amount of resources required to run the job. That&#8217;s where '
 'this new tool, combined with SageMaker, can help.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;With '
 'workflows in Amazon SageMaker, compute resources are pre-configured and '
 'optimized, only provisioned when requested, scaled as needed, and shut down '
 'automatically when jobs complete, offering near 100% utilization,&#8221; '
 'Bindal wrote.</p>\\n<p>Amazon SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes are '
 'available today in select AWS regions.</p>\\n<div class="embed '
